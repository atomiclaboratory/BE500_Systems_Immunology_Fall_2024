# 🧬 **Systems Immunology Course**

## 📚 **Course Overview**
Welcome to the **Systems Immunology** course! This course offers a comprehensive exploration of Systems Immunology, blending foundational knowledge with advanced theoretical concepts and practical applications. Throughout the course, students will engage with cutting-edge research, collaborate on group projects, and gain hands-on experience in applying AI and machine learning techniques to immunological data. Our goal is to equip you with the skills and knowledge necessary to navigate and contribute to the rapidly evolving field of Systems Immunology.

## 📅 **Course Modules**

### **MODULE 1: Immunology 101 – Fundamentals (Week 1)**
- **Objective:** 🧠 Build a foundational understanding of the immune system, including defense mechanisms, disease interactions, and the role of vaccines.
- **Activities:**
  - **Day 1:** Self-paced module where students explore the basics of the immune system through a series of videos, enhancing their comprehension of how the immune system operates.
  - **Day 2:** Reflection and Knowledge Check, where students submit anonymous questions, vote on the most relevant ones, and engage in a class discussion to reinforce their understanding.
- **Expected Outcome:** 🎯 Develop a strong foundational understanding of immunology, setting the stage for more complex topics in subsequent modules.

### **MODULE 2: Systems Immunology – Theory, Methodology & Prospects (Weeks 2-3)**
- **Objective:** 🔬 Transition from basic immunology to advanced concepts in Systems Immunology, emphasizing its importance in understanding complex immune responses and applying AI to immunological questions.
- **Activities:**
  - **Week 2, Day 1:** A lecture by Dr. Tomic that connects the foundational knowledge from Module 1 with Systems Immunology, introducing key concepts and methodologies.
  - **Week 2, Day 2:** Introduction to current applications of Systems Immunology in infections and vaccinations, followed by the assignment of research publications to student groups for analysis and presentation preparation.
  - **Week 3:** Independent group work where students analyze assigned publications and collaborate to prepare presentations.
- **Expected Outcome:** 🎯 Gain skills in critically analyzing scientific literature and collaborating on research presentations.

### **MODULE 3: Systems Immunology in Action – Insights into Infections and Vaccinology (Weeks 4-6)**
- **Objective:** 🌍 Apply the knowledge gained in Module 2 through group presentations that delve into real-world applications of Systems Immunology in the context of infections and vaccine development.
- **Activities:**
  - Each week, a different student group will present their analysis of a key research paper, covering topics such as vaccine efficacy, immune responses to infections, and the role of systems biology in understanding these processes.
- **Expected Outcome:** 🎯 Demonstrate the ability to critically analyze and present complex scientific research, deepening understanding of how Systems Immunology addresses challenges in infections and vaccinology.
