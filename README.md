# üß¨ **Systems Immunology Course**

## üìö **Course Overview**
Welcome to the **Systems Immunology** course. This course offers a comprehensive exploration of Systems Immunology, blending foundational knowledge with advanced theoretical concepts and practical applications. Throughout the course, students will engage with cutting-edge research, collaborate on group projects, and gain hands-on experience in applying AI and machine learning techniques to immunological data. Our goal is to equip you with the skills and knowledge necessary to navigate and contribute to the rapidly evolving field of Systems Immunology.

## üìÖ **Course Modules**

### **MODULE 1: Immunology 101 ‚Äì Fundamentals (Week 1)**
- üß† Introduction to the basic components and functions of the immune system, focusing on defense mechanisms and vaccination.

### **MODULE 2: Systems Immunology ‚Äì Theory, Methodology & Prospects (Weeks 2-3)**
- üî¨Exploration of systems-level approaches in immunology, highlighting the integration of AI and computational tools.

### **MODULE 3: Systems Immunology in Action ‚Äì Insights into Infections and Vaccinology (Weeks 4-6)**
- üåç Apply the knowledge gained in Module 2 and delve into real-world applications of Systems Immunology in the context of infections and vaccine development.

### **MODULE 4: From Theory to Practice ‚Äì AI in Immunological Cases (Weeks 7-14)**
- üíª Transition from theory to hands-on application to use AI and machine learning techniques to analyze immunological data and predict outcomes related to immune responses.
