### Abstract Summary üìÑ

This study uses a systems biology approach to investigate both innate and adaptive immune responses to influenza vaccines in humans over three consecutive influenza seasons. The authors examined healthy adults receiving either the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) or the live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). Their findings show that TIV induced higher antibody titers and more plasmablasts compared to LAIV. Furthermore, early molecular signatures were identified that could predict later antibody responses, with the kinase CaMKIV emerging as a regulator of these responses. These results demonstrate how systems biology can be employed to predict vaccine immunogenicity and uncover new mechanisms behind vaccine efficacy.
