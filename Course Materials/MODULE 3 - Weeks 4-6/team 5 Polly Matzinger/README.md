### Abstract Summary üìÑ

This study investigates the immune factors that influence outcomes in Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Through the analysis of multiple cohorts, it identifies immune signatures that can predict the progression from latent to active tuberculosis. These findings offer critical insights into tuberculosis pathogenesis and may inform the development of new strategies for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.

## Activities üìö

1. **30-Minute Presentation by Team Matzinger (Until 4:00 PM)**  
   Team Matzinger will present their findings on immune signatures in tuberculosis, discussing the differences between latent and active TB. The presentation will explore how systems biology can be applied to understand immune responses that lead to different infection outcomes.

2. **30-Minute Group Discussion (4:00 PM - 4:30 PM)**  
   The class will engage in a discussion on how immune factors contribute to the variability in tuberculosis infection outcomes. This will include examining the immune signatures associated with disease progression and potential therapeutic targets.

3. **Team-task: Danger Theory and Tuberculosis (4:30 PM - 5:15 PM) üí£ü¶†üß¨**
Each team will take 15 minutes to discuss their answer internally, then report back to the class for a roundtable discussion of how **Danger Theory** can explain the immune system's response in the context of tuberculosis infection.

## üí£ What is Danger Theory?

> **Danger Theory**, proposed by Polly Matzinger in 1994, challenges the traditional self-nonself paradigm of the immune system. According to the self-nonself model, the immune system distinguishes between self (the body‚Äôs own tissues) and nonself (foreign entities like pathogens), attacking anything perceived as nonself. However, Matzinger‚Äôs **Danger Theory** suggests that the immune system is more concerned with detecting **damage** than with recognizing foreign. The immune response is triggered by danger signals from injured or stressed cells üÜò, rather than by the mere presence of foreign substances.
> In the context of tuberculosis ü¶†, **Danger Theory** helps us understand how the immune system may respond to the *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* infection, focusing on damage or distress signals from host tissues rather than the bacteria itself.
> For more detailed insight, refer to Matzinger‚Äôs original work:

## Team-task - ü¶† Latent TB: Neo's Case Study

### Scenario:
Imagine a patient named **Neo**, who has been diagnosed with latent tuberculosis (*Mycobacterium tuberculosis* infection) but remains asymptomatic. Neo's immune system is controlling the infection, preventing it from progressing to active disease. Lab results reveal the following:

- NK cell levels have **increased** over the past year.
- Inflammation-related proteins, such as CXCL8 and ADA, are slightly elevated but still within normal ranges.
- T and B cell compartments show mild deviations.
- A recent PET-CT scan of the lungs shows no significant inflammation or damage.

### Quiz Questions:

1. **ü¶† Why have Neo‚Äôs NK cell levels increased during latent TB?**  
   A) NK cells are actively attacking the bacteria.  
   B) NK cells are responding to tissue damage, helping to maintain immune control.  
   C) NK cells are increasing due to the infection becoming active.  
   D) NK cells are irrelevant to TB infection.

2. **üí° What might the mild elevation in inflammation-related proteins (e.g., CXCL8, ADA) in Neo‚Äôs case suggest according to Danger Theory?**  
   A) The immune system is detecting subtle tissue stress or damage, even in the latent state.  
   B) The proteins are elevated because Neo is progressing to active TB.  
   C) These proteins are irrelevant to the infection.  
   D) The immune system is attacking the bacteria directly.

3. **üìâ If Neo‚Äôs NK cell levels suddenly dropped, what would this indicate based on the findings from the TB study?**  
   A) Neo‚Äôs immune system is winning the battle against the infection.  
   B) Neo is likely transitioning from latent to active TB.  
   C) Neo is immune to the effects of the bacteria.  
   D) NK cells are no longer needed as the infection is resolved.

4. **üî¨ Why might deviations in Neo‚Äôs T and B cell compartments occur during latent TB?**  
   A) These cells are reacting to ongoing low-level tissue stress or damage.  
   B) T and B cells are not affected in latent TB.  
   C) The immune system is overreacting to the presence of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*.  
   D) These deviations are a sign that the infection is being cleared.

5. **‚öñÔ∏è How does the immune system's response to distress signals differ between latent and active tuberculosis?**  
   A) In latent TB, the immune system controls the infection with a low-level, ongoing response, while in active TB, the response becomes more aggressive due to increased tissue damage.  
   B) In both latent and active TB, the immune response is the same.  
   C) The immune system only responds to distress signals during active TB.  
   D) In latent TB, the immune system shuts down, while in active TB it becomes fully activated.
