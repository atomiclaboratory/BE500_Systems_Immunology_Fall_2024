### Abstract Summary 📄

This study investigates the immune factors that influence outcomes in Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Through the analysis of multiple cohorts, it identifies immune signatures that can predict the progression from latent to active tuberculosis. These findings offer critical insights into tuberculosis pathogenesis and may inform the development of new strategies for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.

## Activities 📚

1. **30-Minute Presentation by Team Matzinger (Until 4:00 PM)**  
   Team Matzinger will present their findings on immune signatures in tuberculosis, discussing the differences between latent and active TB. The presentation will explore how systems biology can be applied to understand immune responses that lead to different infection outcomes.

2. **30-Minute Group Discussion (4:00 PM - 4:30 PM)**  
   The class will engage in a discussion on how immune factors contribute to the variability in tuberculosis infection outcomes. This will include examining the immune signatures associated with disease progression and potential therapeutic targets.

3. **Team-task: Danger Theory and Tuberculosis (4:30 PM - 5:15 PM) 💣🦠🧬**
Each team will take 15 minutes to discuss their answer internally, then report back to the class for a roundtable discussion of how **Danger Theory** can explain the immune system's response in the context of tuberculosis infection.

## 💣 What is Danger Theory?

**Danger Theory**, proposed by Polly Matzinger in 1994, challenges the traditional self-nonself paradigm of the immune system. According to the self-nonself model, the immune system distinguishes between self (the body’s own tissues) and nonself (foreign entities like pathogens), attacking anything perceived as nonself. However, Matzinger’s **Danger Theory** suggests that the immune system is more concerned with detecting **damage** than with recognizing foreign. The immune response is triggered by danger signals from injured or stressed cells 🆘, rather than by the mere presence of foreign substances.

In the context of tuberculosis 🦠, **Danger Theory** helps us understand how the immune system may respond to the *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* infection, focusing on damage or distress signals from host tissues rather than the bacteria itself.

For more detailed insight, refer to Matzinger’s original work:

### Question: 
How do the immune signatures described in the tuberculosis study reflect the principles of Danger Theory? Can the deviations in immune cell populations (e.g., NK cells, T and B cells) be understood as responses to host tissue damage or distress rather than to the presence of the pathogen itself?

Teams should consider:

- 💣 **Damage Detection**: Are the immune responses, such as the increase in NK cells or inflammation, triggered by damage to host tissues rather than the bacteria itself?
- 🦠 **Latent vs Active TB**: How does the immune system's response to distress signals differ between latent and active tuberculosis?
- 🔬 **Immune Deviations**: Do the changes in T and B cell compartments during TB latency suggest that the immune system is reacting to ongoing tissue stress or low-level damage?
