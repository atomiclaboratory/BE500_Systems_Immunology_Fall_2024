### Abstract Summary 📄

This study investigates the immune factors that influence outcomes in Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Through the analysis of multiple cohorts, it identifies immune signatures that can predict the progression from latent to active tuberculosis. These findings offer critical insights into tuberculosis pathogenesis and may inform the development of new strategies for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.

## Activities 📚

1. **30-Minute Presentation by Team Matzinger (Until 4:00 PM)**  
   Team Matzinger will present their findings on immune signatures in tuberculosis, discussing the differences between latent and active TB. The presentation will explore how systems biology can be applied to understand immune responses that lead to different infection outcomes.

2. **30-Minute Group Discussion (4:00 PM - 4:30 PM)**  
   The class will engage in a discussion on how immune factors contribute to the variability in tuberculosis infection outcomes. This will include examining the immune signatures associated with disease progression and potential therapeutic targets.

3. **Team Tasks: (4:30 PM - 5:15 PM) 💬**  
   Groups will collaborate to analyze case studies and apply systems immunology concepts to identify key immune mechanisms influencing tuberculosis outcomes.
