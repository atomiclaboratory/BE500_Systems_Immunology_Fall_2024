### Abstract Summary ðŸ“„

This study leverages a systems biology approach to prospectively predict the immunogenicity of the yellow fever vaccine (YF-17D) in humans. Using computational and gene expression analyses, the authors identified early gene signatures that predicted immune responses. They discovered gene markers that predicted the CD8+ T cell response and neutralizing antibody response with high accuracy (up to 90% and 100%, respectively), offering insight into how systems biology can improve vaccine efficacy predictions.

## Activities ðŸ“š

1. **30-Minute Presentation by Team Salk (Until 4:00 PM)**  
   Team Salk will present their analysis of the *Nature Immunology* paper, focusing on how a systems biology approach was used to predict vaccine efficacy in humans.

2. **30-Minute Group Discussion (4:00 PM - 4:30 PM)**  
   The class will engage in a detailed discussion of the findings, approaches, and implications presented by Team Salk.

3. **FAIR Data Principles Activity (4:30 PM - 5:15 PM)**  
   - **FAIR Principles Definition:**  
     FAIR stands for *Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability*. It provides guidelines to ensure that scientific data is shared in a manner that enhances its reuse and accessibility.  
   - **Question:** Did the authors share the data in a manner consistent with the FAIR principles?  
     Each team will take 15 minutes to discuss their answer internally, then report back to the class for a 15-minute roundtable discussion. 

   Teams should consider:
   - **Findability:** Is the data properly indexed and retrievable?
   - **Accessibility:** Is the data openly available or under restricted access?
   - **Interoperability:** Can the data be integrated with other datasets and systems?
   - **Reusability:** Is the data well-documented and reusable by others?
