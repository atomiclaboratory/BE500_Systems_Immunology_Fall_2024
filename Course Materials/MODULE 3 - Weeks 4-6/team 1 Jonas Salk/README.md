### Abstract Summary 📄

This study leverages a systems biology approach to prospectively predict the immunogenicity of the yellow fever vaccine (YF-17D) in humans. Using computational and gene expression analyses, the authors identified early gene signatures that predicted immune responses. They discovered gene markers that predicted the CD8+ T cell response and neutralizing antibody response with high accuracy (up to 90% and 100%, respectively), offering insight into how systems biology can improve vaccine efficacy predictions.

## Activities 📚

1. **30-Minute Presentation by Team Salk (Until 4:00 PM)**  
   Team Salk will present their analysis of the *Nature Immunology* paper, focusing on how a systems biology approach was used to predict vaccine efficacy in humans.

2. **30-Minute Group Discussion (4:00 PM - 4:30 PM)**  
   The class will engage in a detailed discussion of the findings, approaches, and implications presented by Team Salk.

3. **FAIR Data Principles Activity (4:30 PM - 5:15 PM)** 🔍🌐🔗♻️  
   - **FAIR Principles Definition:**  
     FAIR stands for *Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability*. It provides guidelines to ensure that scientific data is shared in a manner that enhances its reuse and accessibility.
   - **Question:** Did the authors share the data in a manner consistent with the FAIR principles? If not, how would you ensure FAIR data principles?  
     Each team will take 15 minutes to discuss their answer internally, then report back to the class for a 15-minute roundtable discussion. 

   Teams should consider:
   - **🔍 Findability:** Is the data properly indexed and retrievable?
   - **🌐 Accessibility:** Is the data openly available or under restricted access?
   - **🔗 Interoperability:** Can the data be integrated with other datasets and systems?
   - **♻️ Reusability:** Is the data well-documented and reusable by others?
