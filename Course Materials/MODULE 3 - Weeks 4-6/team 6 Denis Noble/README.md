### Abstract Summary üìÑ

This study investigates immune signatures in COVID-19 patients using multi-omics approaches. The analysis reveals key correlates of disease severity, including acute phase proteins, metabolic processes, and tissue injury markers. Plasma proteome variation identifies sub-phenotypes with different disease severities, while supervised machine learning highlights predictive biomarkers. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis and offer insights for treatment strategies.

### About the COMBAT Consortium üí™

The COMBAT Consortium is working to understand why some patients become severely ill with COVID-19. We aim to use this knowledge to help identify more effective biomarkers and support the development of targeted therapies to improve outcomes for patients.

Here we provide a web tool to visualize the results of deep immune phenotyping in peripheral blood, showing findings for patient donors with COVID-19 of varying severity and comparing them with results from patients with influenza and sepsis, as well as healthy donors.

## Activities üìö

1. **30-Minute Presentation by Team Nobel (Until 4:00 PM)**  
   Team Nobel will present their analysis of COVID-19 immune responses, focusing on plasma protein signatures and sub-phenotypes. They will explore how systems immunology methods reveal hallmarks of COVID-19 responses, emphasizing acute phase proteins, inflammatory mediators, and disease severity.

2. **30-Minute Group Discussion (4:00 PM - 4:30 PM)**  
   The class will engage in a discussion on how the plasma proteome can be used to stratify patients with COVID-19 based on disease severity. This will include examining how machine learning models identified predictive biomarkers for outcomes and therapeutic targets.

3. **Team-task: Interactive Data Exploration using the COMBAT Tool (4:30 PM - 5:15 PM) üíªüìä**  
   Use the [COMBAT Interactive Graphical Abstract](https://mlv.combat.ox.ac.uk/) to explore a specific research question related to COVID-19 immune responses.

### Task: Investigating Neutrophil Signatures in Severe COVID-19 üß¨

**Research Question:**  
Can neutrophil signatures help predict the severity of COVID-19 in patients, and how do these signatures compare with other hallmarks of disease severity?

**Steps:**
- Navigate to the [Interactive Graphical Abstract](https://mlv.combat.ox.ac.uk/).
- Click on the hallmark ‚ÄúNeutrophils COVID severity‚Äù to explore this feature.
- Clicking on individual markers (e.g., expression of single genes related to neutrophils) will display plots on the right-hand side, showing their levels in COVID-19 patients with varying severity.
- Add additional hallmarks for comparison, such as "Monocytes COVID severity" or "Cytokine storm," by using the ‚ÄúLoad Data‚Äù button.
- Compare how neutrophil-related signatures correlate with other features and their predictive power for disease severity.

At the end of the task, discuss how these neutrophil markers might serve as potential biomarkers for predicting severe COVID-19 and the implications for personalized treatment approaches.
