This team will investigate how gender-affirming testosterone treatment affects the immune system, focusing on changes in immune cell populations and inflammatory markers. They will explore the broader implications of hormone therapy on immune function and gender-specific immune adaptations.

### Abstract Summary ðŸ“„

In this study, the authors conducted a longitudinal analysis of 23 transgender men undergoing gender-affirming testosterone treatment to investigate the immune system adaptations during therapy. The results showed that testosterone modulates a cross-regulated axis between type-I interferon and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Specifically, testosterone attenuates type-I interferon responses in plasmacytoid dendritic cells and monocytes while potentiating monocyte-mediated TNF, interleukin-6, and interleukin-15 production. These findings provide insights into how testosterone therapy impacts immune function, with broader implications for sex-divergent immune responses in both transgender and cisgender individuals.

## Activities ðŸ“š

1. **30-Minute Presentation by Team Margulis (Until 4:00 PM)**  
   Team Margulis will present their analysis on how gender-affirming testosterone treatment affects the immune system, with a specific focus on changes in immune cell populations and inflammatory markers.

2. **30-Minute Group Discussion (4:00 PM - 4:30 PM)**  
   The class will engage in a detailed discussion of the broader implications of hormone therapy on immune function. This will include a review of gender-specific immune adaptations during and after treatment, with consideration of how these changes may impact health outcomes in gender-diverse populations.

3. **Team Task: Post-Presentation Discussion (4:30 PM - 5:15 PM) ðŸ’¬**
