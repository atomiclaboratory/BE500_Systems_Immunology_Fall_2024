### Abstract Summary ðŸ“„

In this study, the authors conducted a longitudinal analysis of 23 transgender men undergoing gender-affirming testosterone treatment to investigate the immune system adaptations during therapy. The results showed that testosterone modulates a cross-regulated axis between type-I interferon and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Specifically, testosterone attenuates type-I interferon responses in plasmacytoid dendritic cells and monocytes while potentiating monocyte-mediated TNF, interleukin-6, and interleukin-15 production. These findings provide insights into how testosterone therapy impacts immune function, with broader implications for sex-divergent immune responses in both transgender and cisgender individuals.

## Activities ðŸ“š

1. **30-Minute Presentation by Team Margulis (Until 4:00 PM)**  
   Team Margulis will present their analysis on how gender-affirming testosterone treatment affects the immune system, with a specific focus on changes in immune cell populations and inflammatory markers.

2. **30-Minute Group Discussion (4:00 PM - 4:30 PM)**  
   The class will engage in a detailed discussion of the broader implications of hormone therapy on immune function. This will include a review of gender-specific immune adaptations during and after treatment, with consideration of how these changes may impact health outcomes in gender-diverse populations.

3. **Team Task: Confounding Variables and Gender in Immune Responses (4:30 PM - 5:15 PM) ðŸ’¬**

### Hypothetical Study: Vaccine Efficacy in an Influenza Vaccine Trial
> **Study Design:**
> Researchers are conducting a clinical trial to assess the efficacy of a new influenza vaccine in preventing flu infections among adults aged 18â€“65. The trial includes 1,000 participants, randomly divided into two groups:
      Group 1 receives the new influenza vaccine.
      Group 2 receives a placebo. The primary outcome of interest is the vaccine efficacy, measured by the reduction in flu infections among vaccinated individuals compared to the placebo group.

## Questions:

## Do you control for gender, and how should you account for gender variability in a vaccine efficacy study?

> In your study on influenza vaccine efficacy, would you treat gender as a confounding variable that needs to be controlled, or as a primary variable of interest to account for in your analysis?
> > Controlling: What are the advantages and limitations of this approach in understanding the vaccineâ€™s overall efficacy?
> > Accounting: What are the benefits of this approach in terms of understanding gender-specific immune responses?

## How can accounting for gender variability improve the understanding of vaccine efficacy and health outcomes?

> In the context of your vaccine efficacy study, how would disaggregating data by gender help reveal important differences in how males and females respond to the vaccine?

## What are the potential dangers of controlling for gender without fully acknowledging its importance in vaccine efficacy?

> Can you think of scenarios where simply controlling for genderâ€”without examining its biological and immunological significanceâ€”could lead to misleading conclusions?

### Definition of cofounding variable (ref. Shapiro, Klein and Morgan, 2021)
> A confounding variable is a risk factor for the outcome that is also associated with the predictor, such that the observed relationship between predictor and outcome is confused by the presence of the confounder.

## ðŸ“Š Available Tools for Controlling or Accounting for Gender in Research

### **Controlling for Gender as a Confounding Variable:**

1. **Multiple Linear or Logistic Regression**  
   Include gender as a covariate in the regression model to control for its influence on the outcome. This isolates the relationship between the main predictor and the outcome.

2. **ANCOVA (Analysis of Covariance)**  
   ANCOVA can adjust for gender by treating it as a covariate, allowing the comparison of group outcomes while controlling for gender differences.

---

### **Accounting for Gender as a Variable of Interest:**

1. **Disaggregated Analysis**  
   Run separate analyses for different gender groups to examine how outcomes differ by gender, providing a clearer understanding of gender-specific effects.

2. **Mixed-Effects Models**  
   Include gender as both a fixed effect and a random effect to account for gender differences while also modeling individual variations in longitudinal or hierarchical data.

3. **Supervised Classification Models**  
   When using any supervised classification model (e.g., Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes) with gender as a predictor, you account for gender by including it in the model. If gender does not show up as an important predictor (i.e., it has a low variable importance score or coefficient), this means the model does not find gender to significantly impact the outcome. In this case, you have **accounted** for gender but not explicitly **controlled** for it. Including gender allows the model to evaluate its potential role in influencing the outcome (e.g., vaccine efficacy), but if its importance is low, the data suggests that gender may not be a critical factor in this specific instance.
