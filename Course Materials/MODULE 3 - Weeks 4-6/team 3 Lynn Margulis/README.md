### Abstract Summary ðŸ“„

In this study, the authors conducted a longitudinal analysis of 23 transgender men undergoing gender-affirming testosterone treatment to investigate the immune system adaptations during therapy. The results showed that testosterone modulates a cross-regulated axis between type-I interferon and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Specifically, testosterone attenuates type-I interferon responses in plasmacytoid dendritic cells and monocytes while potentiating monocyte-mediated TNF, interleukin-6, and interleukin-15 production. These findings provide insights into how testosterone therapy impacts immune function, with broader implications for sex-divergent immune responses in both transgender and cisgender individuals.

## Activities ðŸ“š

1. **30-Minute Presentation by Team Margulis (Until 4:00 PM)**  
   Team Margulis will present their analysis on how gender-affirming testosterone treatment affects the immune system, with a specific focus on changes in immune cell populations and inflammatory markers.

2. **30-Minute Group Discussion (4:00 PM - 4:30 PM)**  
   The class will engage in a detailed discussion of the broader implications of hormone therapy on immune function. This will include a review of gender-specific immune adaptations during and after treatment, with consideration of how these changes may impact health outcomes in gender-diverse populations.

3. **Team Task: Confounding Variables and Gender in Immune Responses (4:30 PM - 5:15 PM) ðŸ’¬**

### Hypothetical Study: Vaccine Efficacy in an Influenza Vaccine Trial
> **Study Design:**
> Researchers are conducting a clinical trial to assess the efficacy of a new influenza vaccine in preventing flu infections among adults aged 18â€“65. The trial includes 1,000 participants, randomly divided into two groups:
      Group 1 receives the new influenza vaccine.
      Group 2 receives a placebo. The primary outcome of interest is the vaccine efficacy, measured by the reduction in flu infections among vaccinated individuals compared to the placebo group.

## Questions:

## Do you control for gender, and how should you account for gender variability in a vaccine efficacy study?

> In your study on influenza vaccine efficacy, would you treat gender as a confounding variable that needs to be controlled, or as a primary variable of interest to account for in your analysis?
> > Controlling: What are the advantages and limitations of this approach in understanding the vaccineâ€™s overall efficacy?
> > Accounting: What are the benefits of this approach in terms of understanding gender-specific immune responses?

## How can accounting for gender variability improve the understanding of vaccine efficacy and health outcomes?

> In the context of your vaccine efficacy study, how would disaggregating data by gender help reveal important differences in how males and females respond to the vaccine?

## What are the potential dangers of controlling for gender without fully acknowledging its importance in vaccine efficacy?

> Can you think of scenarios where simply controlling for genderâ€”without examining its biological and immunological significanceâ€”could lead to misleading conclusions?

### Definition of cofounding variable (ref. Shapiro, Klein and Morgan, 2021)
> A confounding variable is a risk factor for the outcome that is also associated with the predictor, such that the observed relationship between predictor and outcome is confused by the presence of the confounder.
