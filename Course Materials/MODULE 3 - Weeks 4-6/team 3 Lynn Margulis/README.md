## Team 3 - Lynn Margulis

**Members:**
- Kaavya Akula  
- Joseph Soto  
- Marek Pinto

### Abstract Summary ðŸ“„

In this study, the authors conducted a longitudinal analysis of 23 transgender men undergoing gender-affirming testosterone treatment to investigate the immune system adaptations during therapy. The results showed that testosterone modulates a cross-regulated axis between type-I interferon and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Specifically, testosterone attenuates type-I interferon responses in plasmacytoid dendritic cells and monocytes while potentiating monocyte-mediated TNF, interleukin-6, and interleukin-15 production. These findings provide insights into how testosterone therapy impacts immune function, with broader implications for sex-divergent immune responses in both transgender and cisgender individuals.

## Activities ðŸ“š

1. **30-Minute Presentation by Team Margulis (Until 4:00 PM)**  
   Team Margulis will present their analysis on how gender-affirming testosterone treatment affects the immune system, with a specific focus on changes in immune cell populations and inflammatory markers.

2. **30-Minute Group Discussion (4:00 PM - 4:30 PM)**  
   The class will engage in a detailed discussion of the broader implications of hormone therapy on immune function. This will include a review of gender-specific immune adaptations during and after treatment, with consideration of how these changes may impact health outcomes in gender-diverse populations.

3. **Team Task: Confounding Variables and Gender in Immune Responses (4:30 PM - 5:15 PM) ðŸ’¬**

   ### Question: **What Are Confounding Variables and Why Should Gender Be Considered When Analyzing Immune Responses?**

   **Student Question:**  
   Should you control for gender in your study, and how should you account for gender variability when examining health outcomes?

   **Example Discussion Points:**
   - **Do you control for gender, and how should you account for gender variability?**
     - In your research, would you treat gender as a confounding variable to control for, or would you treat it as a variable of primary interest? What are the advantages and potential pitfalls of each approach, particularly when considering immune responses, treatment outcomes, or vaccine efficacy?
   
   - **How can accounting for gender variability improve health outcomes?**
     - In global health research, how can disaggregating data by sex and gender improve the understanding of health outcomes (e.g., immune response, disease treatment, vaccine efficacy)? How might this approach impact the development of more effective and equitable health interventions?

   - **What are the potential dangers of controlling for sex and gender without acknowledging their importance?**
     - Can you think of examples where controlling for sex or gender without considering their biological or social importance could lead to harmful or inaccurate conclusions? Discuss the potential risks of ignoring gender as a variable that contributes to different health outcomes.

### ðŸ”§ **Student Activity:**

- **Group Discussion:** In small groups, students will choose a hypothetical study on a health outcome (e.g., vaccine efficacy, autoimmune disease prevalence, or drug treatment effectiveness). They will decide whether to treat **gender as a confounding variable** or as a **primary variable of interest**, justifying their decision. 
- **Case Study Analysis:** Analyze a case where **controlling for gender** led to misleading results, and propose an alternative approach that takes gender differences into account to improve study outcomes.
- **Application:** Students will create a study design that incorporates **gender-responsive research** to ensure that differences between genders are fully understood and acknowledged in the analysis, instead of simply being controlled.
