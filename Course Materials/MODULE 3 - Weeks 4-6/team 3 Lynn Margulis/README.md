### Abstract Summary ðŸ“„

In this study, the authors conducted a longitudinal analysis of 23 transgender men undergoing gender-affirming testosterone treatment to investigate the immune system adaptations during therapy. The results showed that testosterone modulates a cross-regulated axis between type-I interferon and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Specifically, testosterone attenuates type-I interferon responses in plasmacytoid dendritic cells and monocytes while potentiating monocyte-mediated TNF, interleukin-6, and interleukin-15 production. These findings provide insights into how testosterone therapy impacts immune function, with broader implications for sex-divergent immune responses in both transgender and cisgender individuals.

### 3A: How should you account for gender variability in a vaccine efficacy study?

## Hypothetical Study: Vaccine Efficacy in an Influenza Vaccine Trial
> **Study Design:**
> Researchers are conducting a clinical trial to assess the efficacy of a new influenza vaccine in preventing flu infections among adults aged 18â€“65. The trial includes 1,000 participants, randomly divided into two groups:
      Group 1 receives the new influenza vaccine.
      Group 2 receives a placebo. The primary outcome of interest is the vaccine efficacy, measured by the reduction in flu infections among vaccinated individuals compared to the placebo group.

## In your study on influenza vaccine efficacy, would you treat gender as a confounding variable that needs to be controlled, or as a primary variable of interest to account for in your analysis?
> Controlling: What are the advantages and limitations of this approach in understanding the vaccineâ€™s overall efficacy?
> Accounting: What are the benefits of this approach in terms of understanding gender-specific immune responses?

> > Answer: Controlling for gender simplifies analysis by adjusting for genderâ€™s influence, assuming vaccine efficacy is the same for both genders. This approach helps isolate the overall effect of the vaccine but risks missing important gender-specific differences. Accounting for gender allows for deeper insights into how males and females might respond differently to the vaccine. This can lead to a better understanding of gender-specific immune responses and more tailored vaccine strategies.

## How can accounting for gender variability improve the understanding of vaccine efficacy and health outcomes?

> In the context of your vaccine efficacy study, how would disaggregating data by gender help reveal important differences in how males and females respond to the vaccine?

> > Answer: Disaggregating data by gender can reveal differences in how men and women respond to the vaccine, such as stronger immune responses in females. This information can lead to more personalized dosing recommendations, ensuring the vaccine is equally effective across genders. By recognizing these differences, vaccine strategies can become more equitable, optimizing protection for all individuals and reducing health disparities.

## What are the potential dangers of controlling for gender without fully acknowledging its importance in vaccine efficacy?

> Can you think of scenarios where simply controlling for genderâ€”without examining its biological and immunological significanceâ€”could lead to misleading conclusions?

> > Answer: Simply controlling for gender might mask important differences, such as females generally having a stronger immune response to vaccines. This could lead to incorrect conclusions about the vaccineâ€™s efficacy in different gender groups. Ignoring gender-specific effects could result in underestimating the vaccine's efficacy for females or overestimating it for males, potentially leading to inappropriate public health recommendations or missed opportunities for gender-specific interventions.

### 3B: How does gender impact the performance of the COMBAT ML model in predicting patient outcomes?

> Discuss whether gender should be treated as a confounding variable or as a primary variable of interest in this model.

> > Answer: To interpret this data through the lens of gender, here are some key points to consider:

1. Sample Distribution by Gender:

    In both sepsis and COVID-19 groups, the gender distribution is quite similar:
        Sepsis Group: 40% female (6 out of 15), 60% male (9 out of 15).
        COVID-19 Group: 40% female (21 out of 53), 60% male (32 out of 53).

This indicates that the male-to-female ratio is consistent across the two groups, suggesting that gender distribution does not significantly differ between the two conditions. Therefore, gender is not a confounding factor in terms of the sample distribution between sepsis and COVID-19.

2. Age Comparison:

    The median age between sepsis and COVID-19 patients is slightly different:
        Sepsis: Median age = 64 years (IQR 52-79)
        COVID-19: Median age = 57 years (IQR 47.5-66.5)
        P-value = 0.0969, which is not statistically significant, suggesting that age differences between sepsis and COVID-19 patients are not substantial enough to be considered a confounding variable when comparing outcomes.

3. Gender-Specific Inference:

    Interpretation of Results Through Gender:
        Since the gender distribution is similar and not statistically different, gender alone doesn't appear to be driving differences between the sepsis and COVID-19 groups.
        To better understand genderâ€™s impact, you could disaggregate the data and analyze whether gender affects outcomes such as disease severity or recovery rates differently in sepsis vs. COVID-19.
        Even though gender isn't statistically significant in the overall distribution, it could still be an important biological factor influencing immune responses, which would require a deeper dive into specific gender-based outcomes in these patient groups.

Further Steps for Gender Analysis:

    Disaggregate Severity by Gender: Examine whether males or females have a higher likelihood of severe or critical cases in each group.
    Multivariate Analysis: Include gender as a covariate in a regression model to see if it interacts with other factors (e.g., age, disease severity) to influence outcomes differently in sepsis and COVID-19 patients.

### Definition of cofounding variable (ref. Shapiro, Klein and Morgan, 2021)
> A confounding variable is a risk factor for the outcome that is also associated with the predictor, such that the observed relationship between predictor and outcome is confused by the presence of the confounder.

### **Controlling for Gender as a Confounding Variable:**

1. **[Multiple Linear or Logistic Regression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html#logistic-regression)**  
   Include gender as a covariate in the regression model to control for its influence on the outcome. This isolates the relationship between the main predictor and the outcome. Learn more about how to implement logistic regression with scikit-learn in Python.

2. **[ANCOVA (Analysis of Covariance)](https://www.statisticshowto.com/ancova/)**  
   ANCOVA can adjust for gender by treating it as a covariate, allowing the comparison of group outcomes while controlling for gender differences. This link provides an introduction and examples on how to perform ANCOVA.

### **Accounting for Gender as a Variable of Interest:**

1. **Disaggregated Analysis**  
   Run separate analyses for different gender groups to examine how outcomes differ by gender, providing a clearer understanding of gender-specific effects. This source gives a detailed explanation of disaggregated analysis and its importance in research.

2. **[Mixed-Effects Models](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2515245920960351)**  
   Include gender as both a fixed effect and a random effect to account for gender differences while also modeling individual variations in longitudinal or hierarchical data. This document provides an overview of mixed-effects models and how they can be used in research.

3. **[Supervised Classification Models](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html)**  
   When using any supervised classification model (e.g., Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes) with gender as a predictor, you account for gender by including it in the model. If gender does not show up as an important predictor (i.e., it has a low variable importance score or coefficient), this means the model does not find gender to significantly impact the outcome. In this case, you have **accounted** for gender but not explicitly **controlled** for it.
